      "Remember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore NEVER store passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private).\n",

If you’re doing it locally, be sure to also have duckdb pip installed (even before the duckdb package is loaded).\n",
